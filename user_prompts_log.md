# Task Tracker Development - User Prompts Log

*A record of the prompts used to build a GitHub-synced task tracking app with Claude*

## Initial Request
```
please build me a basic task-tracking app that can store tasks in the browser itself on the client side
```

## LocalStorage Implementation
```
Yes, please, I want local storage
```

## GitHub Integration Troubleshooting
```
I put in the details needed for GitHub, but I get the error "Please configure GitHub settings first."
```

```
I get "‚ùå Repository not found. Check the repository name."
```

```
it starts with github_pat
```

```
Excellent this works
```

## Task Organization Features
```
Can you make it such that the tasks that are completed move down and the tasks are show sorted by priority?
```

## UI/UX Improvements
```
on reload, can the github settings be hidden by default
```

```
can the list of tasks be sorted by priority?
```

*[User shared a screenshot showing priority sorting issues]*

## Data Format Change
```
Can you make the backing file a markdown file so that I can read it online without the HTML Page?
```

## Design Overhaul
```
Can you make the writing more aesthetically pleasing and change the color palette to be dark themed and minimalistic?
```

```
Make more efficient use of the screen space
```

## Visual Refinements
```
The green color for the github buttons is too bright.
```

```
The locations of github buttons does not make sense
```

## Configuration Improvements
```
Under github settings, remind that the tokens supported are the classic tokens
```

## Priority Management Enhancement
```
Can you add the ability to change the priority for tasks? Also instead of having two buttons one for task priority and one to add task. Just add three buttons for medium, high and low, such that clicking them adds them.
```

## Documentation Request
```
Write the prompts I used into a Markdown file
```
